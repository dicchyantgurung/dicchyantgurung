# Hey! I'm Dicchyant!

Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer offering extensive background in Finance and Project Management. 

Experienced in Data Engineering (Python, R, SQL), Statistical Analysis (A/B testing), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy), and Deep Learning (Keras). Highly skilled in synthesizing complex information and Data Storytelling (Tableau) to engage shareholders in a productive dialogue that drives business results. Strong skills in team collaboration with a passion and curiosity for all things data!

More personally, Iâ€™m very career oriented but also like to dive into new hobbies whenever I can. I'm a pretty laid back most of the time, but also operate with a sense of urgency when needed, which has allowed me to stay calm under pressure yet achieve maximum results! I also love researching and talking about human psychology, how thought patterns lead to development of personalities and how one can use it to better themselves.

In my free time, I love to travel, get involved in semi-extreme sports such as cliff jumping, dirt biking, and surfing. I aim to get a piloting license some day soon and get into track racing with both cars and motrocycles.
