More personally, I’m very career oriented but also like to dive into new hobbies whenever I can. I'm pretty laid back most of the time, but also operate with a sense of urgency when needed, which has allowed me to stay calm under pressure yet achieve maximum results! I have a very inquisitive mind and I love researching things that interest me at the time and learning everything I can about it. 🥇

In my free time, I love to travel, get involved in semi-extreme sports such as cliff jumping, dirt biking, and surfing. I have also always been fascinated by airplanes and aim to getting a piloting license soon to fly over the weekends. 🏍️ 🏄 🛩️
